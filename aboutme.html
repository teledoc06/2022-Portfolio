	 <h3>Hobbies</h3>
	  <p1>Some of my favorite hobbies are hiking and playing video games. My favorite season is winter because it provides my favorite weather for being inside and being outside. I love the snow of winter because it allows you to hike up mountain trails with sleds, and sled for a couple of minutes on the way down.</p1>
	 <h3>Interests</h3>	
	  <p2>I hope to study medicine when I am older. To achieve this goal I am taking classes based on biology and other sciences related to medicine. My dad is an Emergency Room doctor which inspires me to go into medicine. My favorite classes to take are medical and scientific based classes so I can see myself enjoying a career in science.</p2>
